I guess at the moment, I'm speaking to nobody in particular, and I'm not *entirely* sure what or how much I'll be posting here. This is mainly going to be a way to self document the history and progress of my homelab as it continues to develop. I'm nearly 2 years into the labbing process so I've done a lot already, and have likely already forgotten a lot of what I'd like to have posted. But alas, such are the consequences of taking so long to get this started in the first place.
